# Theoretical questions
## Warmup

### Question 1:

What is modular programming? Why is it important?

### Question 2:

What is module coupling, and why is it a good idea to minimize it?

### Question 3:

Which of the following are true about modular programming? (Some things might be true in general, but not specific to modular programming‚è§in that case do not check the box.)
- [ ] We should divide any function longer than 25 lines into several smaller functions
- [ ] We should attempt to identify code duplication and refactor it
- [ ] It makes it harder to test the code behaviour
- [ ] It always reduces code size
- [ ] It allows the work to be divided among different developers

### Question 4:

What are some advantages of modular programming?

### Question 5:

What is the role of interfaces? When would you use an abstract class instead of an interface?
