# Refactoring

A common task for programmers is to refactor legacy code. Consider the following code written by a beginner programmer which models a BankAccount from which you can deposit and retrieve money. How would you refactor it ?

One approach to this exercise is to first consider which tasks are being performed in each function, and to refactor the code to separate each of these tasks into separate functions.

Feel free to use additional storage for the different values.

```java


public class BankAccount {
    public enum CurrencyType {
        DOLLAR, EURO, POUND;
    }

    public BankAccount(CurrencyType currencyType, double ammount) {
        this.currencyType = currencyType;
        this.amount = ammount;
    }

    private CurrencyType currencyType;
    private double ammount;

    public boolean add(CurrencyType addedType, double addedAmmount) {
        double inCurrency = 0;
        if(currencyType == addedType) {
            inCurrency = addedAmmount;
        }
        else if(currencyType == CurrencyType.DOLLAR && addedType == CurrencyType.EURO) {
            inCurrency = 1.15 * addedAmmount;
        }
        else if(currencyType == CurrencyType.DOLLAR && addedType == CurrencyType.POUND) {
            inCurrency = 1.31 * addedAmmount;
        }
        else if(currencyType == CurrencyType.EURO && addedType == CurrencyType.DOLLAR) {
            inCurrency = 0.87 * addedAmmount;
        }
        else if(currencyType == CurrencyType.EURO && addedType == CurrencyType.POUND) {
            inCurrency = 1.14 * addedAmmount;
        }
        else if(currencyType == CurrencyType.POUND && addedType == CurrencyType.DOLLAR) {
            inCurrency = 0.76 * addedAmmount;
        }
        else if(currencyType == CurrencyType.POUND && addedType == CurrencyType.EURO) {
            inCurrency = 0.88 * addedAmmount;
        }
        ammount += inCurrency;
        return true;
    }

    public boolean remove(CurrencyType removedType, double removedAmmount) {
        double inCurrency = 0;
        if(currencyType == removedType) {
            inCurrency = removedAmmount;
        }
        else if(currencyType == CurrencyType.DOLLAR && removedType == CurrencyType.EURO) {
            inCurrency = 1.15 * removedAmmount;
        }
        else if(currencyType == CurrencyType.DOLLAR && removedType == CurrencyType.POUND) {
            inCurrency = 1.31 * removedAmmount;
        }
        else if(currencyType == CurrencyType.EURO && removedType == CurrencyType.DOLLAR) {
            inCurrency = 0.87 * removedAmmount;
        }
        else if(currencyType == CurrencyType.EURO && removedType == CurrencyType.POUND) {
            inCurrency = 1.14 * removedAmmount;
        }
        else if(currencyType == CurrencyType.POUND && removedType == CurrencyType.DOLLAR) {
            inCurrency = 0.76 * removedAmmount;
        }
        else if(currencyType == CurrencyType.POUND && removedType == CurrencyType.EURO) {
            inCurrency = 0.88 * removedAmmount;
        }
        if(inCurrency > ammount) {
            return false;
        }
        ammount -= inCurrency;
        return true;
    }

    public CurrencyType getCurrencyType() {
        return currencyType;
    }

    public double getAmount() {
        return amount;
    }
}
