# Writing Representation Invariants

One of your teammates is in charge of developing a bunch of data structures for your team to use. While going about his task, he implements a directed graph using an adjacency matrix. An Adjacency Matrix in a graph with _N_ nodes is an _N_ x _N_ square matrix. An entry in the matrix _A<sub>ij</sub>_ is 1 iff there exists a directed edge from Node _i_ to Node _j_, and is 0 otherwise. 

When it was time to implement a directed tree, your teammate's laziness surfaced. Since the set of all directed trees is a subset of all directed graphs, he decided to use the same adjacency matrix to implement the directed tree as well. 

Unfortunately, not every graph is a tree, and it is now your job to write the representation invariant which specifies the set of conditions on the adjacency matrix to ensure that it's a directed tree and not a generic directed graph.

Hints: You must check for the following properties for a graph to be a tree:
- There exists a single root (in-degree 0)
- Every node other than the root has a single parent (in-degree 1)
- The graph contains no cycles
